  <li>Introduction to dumbphones and Digital Minimalism.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dumbphones are a particularly new phenomenon in our society in the last couple of years because of the excessive use of technology, the lack of human connection with others has shown its ugly head and a lot of people are looking for ways to get out of this vicious cycle. This can affect people on many different levels personally on the individual. How one makes these changes to their life starts off with a realization that something is seriously wrong, and they just can’t put a finger on it because of the intense emotions that they are feeling because of the reality they are in. Examples can be feeling distressed, anxious, and confusion. There are a lot of people saying that dumbphones can help us with our digital habits meanwhile making a lifestyle change can help us even better if we just did not replace the technology that we already use.</p>

<p>There are two main sectors in this flourishing environment where it is somewhat of a tug of war between each other. One side says that dumbphones are the way to go and it helps as a ‘digital detox’ from your mind for a week or two. The other side is a dedicated group of people that simply changing our habits and how we consume our media from our phones and other places of technology, we can live a much more full-filling life if we just acknowledge our issues with technology and changing habits and view to accommodate this new lifestyle.</p>

<p>What are the main differences between the both of them with their textbook definitions and see how they compare over this overview analysis of what dumbphones and digital minimalism as a whole are.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Digital Minimalism?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few thing that are in the way first because there are a lot of confusion on how these terms are being used. Firstly is “Digital Minimalism. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else."</code> Cal Newport’s definition is spot on when it comes to the essence of Digital Minimalism as a lifestyle and how people can live. It shows that people can still use modern technology without the burdens of being hooked on their own electronic devices. Examples could be finding other ways to spend your time wisely instead of it being on an electronic device. There are many guides that people have made but this is one of them that is a great starting point.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does dumbphones interact with this equation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dumbphones are one of the solutions that people gravitate towards because it seems like it should the perfect device for their needs. A lot of people do not see the bigger picture until they use the phone after a few days. The two big reasons that people buy a dumbphone that it feels like they are holding something nostalgic because maybe they used one when they were younger, or they want stand out in the crowd from all the glass rectangular shapes in their pockets. As humans we want to stand out from our peers because of some social status or they just want to try something new because an algorithm has put it in their feed. It is understandable why someone would go out and buy one. When they get their package in the mail with their chosen dumbphone of choice (It could be a Nokia, a Japanese Keitai, or an Android flip phone). The rose tinted glasses seem to fade away and the heartbreak starts to settle in. The main hurdles that people have encountered these issues using a dumbphones is cell reception, because it could mean that it is not compatible in their area of in North America and it only used 3G connections. So they reverted back to their smartphone, just because it worked. Another would be trying to use WhatsApp or listen to Spotify one the dumbphone. A lot of people thought wondering “I spending money on things that should help me while I could make their own dumbphone myself using my current smartphone?.”</p>

<p>Reading Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism on how he planned out time wisely, he mentions that you just need to make use of what you have first and work forward from there within your means. (insert page number) by using his 30 day ‘Digital declutter’ where he tells his readers that they leave out most stuff on their phones and keep all the important stuff on in case its for a job, or family. This had the realization that you just do not need a dumbphone to make yourself as a digital minimalist, you just need to focus on what mattered most in your life. It is incredibly painful that people in a modern society having to deal with smartphones and a technology that truly makes us distracted.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The hardships with dumbphones in the current society.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the hardest parts about owning a dumbphone in our current modern society are that everything is turning into a QR Code. That includes restaurant, taking public transportation and the most unsettling are that governments are using more digital services than ever before. Having a dumbphone in most of these places may get yourself into some headache because most restaurants cannot provide you with a paper menu or that train ticket is only valid if its only on a smartphone. These problems are just the top level of the problems of owning a dumbphone, because there are a lot of good with owning a dumbphone including the removable battery or the SD Card slot and the best part that it does not bother you until you get a phone call.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What can a person do to keep being digital minimalist while keeping their smartphones “dumb”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly you need to examine the habits that you use your current smartphone for and what you truly need to keep it simple. The definition of what Digital Minimalism is can be looked at and applied anywhere with our uses in modern technology, like our phones and especially the overlooked desktops, laptops and our tablets. To keep this all in order and in harmony is to ask yourself a few questions, <em>“Why do I feel while checking my phone during meals, conversations or commutes?”</em>, <em>“How many hours do I spend while mindlessly scrolling at nothing?”</em> and <em>“How well I’m I holding this important relationship together only though a screen?”.</em></p>

<p>Secondarily, You should be looking at writing down all distractions that you get from your phone while working or in your classes. Title it a distraction cheat-sheet and then write down all the things that can bother you. For example, it could be all the social media applications on your phone, those music playlist that Spotify gives you, or it could be the screen itself.</p>

<p>Lastly, Write and talk to your friends and family that you won’t be active a lot in the next couple of day on these platforms because you are only going to check it once a day on the computer or on your laptop. Explain your reasons why but try not to be over the top and saying that doing a ‘digital detox’ is good for my mental health. Just say that I am going to try something different in my routine to see what happens. Try not to be prideful over what you doing to save yourself, You want others to see the change and they will soon ask you why that is so.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Final thoughts and conclusion.</li>
</ul>

<p>We come down to the conclusion of this short essay about how dumbphones and Digital Minimalism intersect and how you can proceed with your overall lifestyle choices. The examples taken would be to priotize the use cases that you currently have in your favour like what can you do that is in your control to remove the distractions from your dialy life and how to proceed going forward. You can simply plan out your day by putting your phone in your backpack instead of your front pocket, or intentionally forgetting your earbuds at home so you can expirence life without the playlists that Spotify gives you.</p>

<p>Explore what you can do within your own means and find that lane that really helps you keep going meanwhile enjoying life that you oh so wanted. All because you were distressed, anxious, and confusion. You currently have the door open, now it is your choice to walk through it.</p>
