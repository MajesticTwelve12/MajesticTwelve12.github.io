### It has been a while...

I have made this blog for me to write about my thoughts, but I havent commited anything because of my disipline.

So I am going to use this to write about about my thoughts on productivity, on how I write and trying to get work done using logseq, obsidian and other types of programs so I can focus on my studies.

So, I will be trying to commit at least one good blog post a week so I can think about the future.

What I want from my future is just wanting some happiness so I can focus on reading my books, and taking care of myself through self improvement.
For example, reading every night, keeping my phones (Yes I have many phones) out of the bedroom, and just trying to keep it together.

The courses that I would like to take are some cyber security exams so I can get certified so I can find some stability in a good work environment, whatever that means. but here I am...

Anyway, I will try to keep in progress in here so I can show what I have to offer.
