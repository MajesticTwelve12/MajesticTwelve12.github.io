&lt;p&gt;I have made this blog for me to write about my thoughts, but I havent commited anything because of my disipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am going to use this to write about about my thoughts on productivity, on how I write and trying to get work done using logseq, obsidian and other types of programs so I can focus on my studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I will be trying to commit at least one good blog post a week so I can think about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want from my future is just wanting some happiness so I can focus on reading my books, and taking care of myself through self improvement.
For example, reading every night, keeping my phones (Yes I have many phones) out of the bedroom, and just trying to keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The courses that I would like to take are some cyber security exams so I can get certified so I can find some stability in a good work environment, whatever that means. but here I am…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I will try to keep in progress in here so I can show what I have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
