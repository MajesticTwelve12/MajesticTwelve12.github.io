    <p>Thinking ahead… What does that really mean, especially when it comes down to your future and the life you want to live in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Talk about your friend and how you became a prolific writer in journaling and how it lead to you envisioning your life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How did it happen, and what plans you can do to make it even better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did you do to make it do much better…. and so on while keeping the statement on the top reletivly the same… but not too boring.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thinking ahead and how the people can influence your life…</p>

<p>Myself being a young guy thinking about all the things that the world has to offer but is overwhelmed with the never ending possiblities is one of the most diffitcult choices that one could make in their entire life. For example, I enjoy myself a lot of personal writing time in my journaling and reading, because a close friend of mine told me to try it because of the amount of stress I was dealing at the time, especially when it came to planning and coming to visit him aboard. It did lead me to understand that I should probably try doing that for a living, then I pause and think about how is the landscape going to change in the next couple of years. The first main reasons are  because of the advancement of artifical inteligence and how it could write faster than anyone in the world because of their large datasets that they gather from sites like this. Second are that companies are only willing to hire contract workers because it saves them time and money. Lasty is that people’s attention span has dropped considerably because of the likes of short from video content and other forms of technology that are made to distract you and I from people understanding about the world.</p>

<p>Then it leads into overthinking and this is one of the worst places that one person could be in because of the never ending thought process and worrying about what ever is going to happen next, happens. It shows up in everyones lives no matter where they are in the world, and people need stop thinking and just do it. Writing this blog has some huge gaps in here because of the endless thought processes that I go through because of the endless amount of content that I would like to write never seems to come to frutition.</p>

<p>To break this cylcle we need to make new healthy habits that can change people’s ways of thinking into something that is thought up and written down on a page or on this blog. So what does this mean for thinking ahead? You need to make an action plan that can get you from A to Z as quickly and as smoothy as possible to you end destination or goal. For example, working to get that big promotion at your job or changing your life style where it can benefit you or your partner. So when it comes to journaling, a good friend of mine wanted to gift for my birthday and he said that these two things changed his life and I believed in him.</p>
